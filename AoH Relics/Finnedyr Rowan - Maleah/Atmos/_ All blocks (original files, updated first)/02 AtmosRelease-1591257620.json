I am so happy for you to continue on your journey with Atmos. We at Warbeard's Slammin' Flammin' Kablammin' War Supplies are all about our customers and their safety. For that reason, we have included a new Atmos Release system, allowing people to remove the Atmos Bolt from something it wasn't supposed to be in the first place! \n**Please use caution when using the Atmos Release system, Atmos bolt removal is known to cause profuse bleeding!**\nThrough the magical power of *STEAM* the Atmos Bolt is able to release itself from its target from a distance. Just bend your elbow at *exactly* 40 degrees Celsius and oppa! The top of the line Atmos Bolt is released!\n**Seriously, please be ready to patch up any wounds opened after using the Atmos Release system!**\n-\n-\nTargets Any creature or object you are considered Connected to.\nWith the power of steam, apparently, the bolt Connected to the target is released, causing you to become disconnected from the target, losing the Connected trait. \nIf your target was a creature, releasing will cause the target to bleed, gaining 1d4 Persistent Bleed damage.\nLevel 9: Increase Persistent Bleed damage to 2d4\nLevel 13: Increase Persistent Bleed damage to 3d4\nLevel 20: Increase Persistent Bleed damage to 5d4\n-\nAfter releasing the Atmos, you have to reel up the bolt to ready it for another Strike. \nReload (A) interact; You reel the bolt back into the barrel of the Atmos by turning the wheel on the outside of the Atmos' elbow counter-clockwise. Seems unintuitive.","meta":{"public":0,"url":"4rX5Y8x9"}}

The best of the best! We beat the rest! *Literally!* Let's learn the basics of your new Atmos arm through these simple steps! We will start our instructions with basic operation of the Atmos bolt system. On the inside of the wrist on the Atmos device, you can see an *Easy-to-Release* switch, allowing for Atmos' hand to open into the barrel of the forearm. \n**Please use caution while operating the barrel, too many eyes have been lost!**\nThe hand on the Atmos should pivot on the hinge on top of your wrist and magnetize to the top of your forearm, for use with the *Easy-to-Clean* features of the Atmos. Atmos was made for *you* in mind. In the barrel is your charged bolt, ready to fire now that your new Atmos hand is out of the way! Please point it away from your face and anyone you care about and pull the ring found near Atmos' inner elbow. Give it a tug! \n**Warbeard's Slammin' Flammin' Kablammin' War Supplies is not responsible for any damages done with the Atmos. If it destroys what's in front of it and causes witnesses to shit themselves, it _is working_ as designed!***\nBoom! Hope that didn't scare you... try not to develop an irrational fear of things that are permanently bound to your person! Now, let's get into the specifics of your new abilities! \n-\n-\nYou automatically gain the following abilities:\n**Atmos Assault**: Launch your Atmos bolt at a target to Connect to the target.\n**Atmos Release**: Remove your Atmos bolt from a Connected target.\n**Yank**: Pull on a Connected target to bring them closer.\n-\n*No refunds!","meta":{"public":0,"url":"VRYXWrwb"}}

If the an object collides with the target they take half the damage of the distance the object traveled after 5 feet as fall damage.\nFailure As success, but target creature gets forcefully pulled towards the Bala Plokami. \nCritical Failure As Failure, the creature is considered restrained by the object it ended its movement with, not just grabbed.\n-\nCreatures that are pulled together do not occupy the same square after colliding, instead they occupy adjacent squares. If the Plokami is Connected to two or more sturdy objects, *Bala Whipper Retract* will not bring those objects together but will bring any other movable objects and creatures towards the tension point between the sturdy object's spaces, approximating the exact square.

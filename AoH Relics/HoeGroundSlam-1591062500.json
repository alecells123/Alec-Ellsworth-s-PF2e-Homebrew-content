You have the ability to use the shove action on the target (target cannot be more than one size larger than you, unless you have an ability that also affects Shove allowing you to do so).\nTrigger Your connected target has become flat-footed because they are airborne without a fly speed. \nYou fucking slam the shit out of your connected target out of the sky and into a target square within The Hoe Summoner's range. This adds The Hoe Summoner's range in fall damage to the connected target. If thrown into square with another creature, usual Falling On A Creature rules apply (Core Rulebook p. 464), except the Reflex Save DC is your Class DC. \nLevel 13: The additional fall damage granted to connected target is increased to The Hoe Summoner's range plus 15\nLevel 17: The additional fall damage granted to connected target is increased to The Hoe Summoner's range plus 25\nLevel 20: The additional fall damage granted to connected target is increased to The Hoe Summoner's range plus 35","meta":{"public":0,"url":"CflTMvq9"}}

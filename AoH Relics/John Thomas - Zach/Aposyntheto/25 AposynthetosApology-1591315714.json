You gain a +4 circumstance bonus to AC against the triggering attack. You cannot use this feat to deflect unusually massive ranged projectiles (such as boulders or ballista bolts). If the attack were to be successful only because of a fortune effect on the attack roll, you automatically raise Aposyntheto's Shard Point value by the same amount you spent on this use of *Aposyntheto's Apology*.

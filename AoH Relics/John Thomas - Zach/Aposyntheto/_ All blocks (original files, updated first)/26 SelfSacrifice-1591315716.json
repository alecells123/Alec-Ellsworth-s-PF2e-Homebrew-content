You and Aposyntheto combine your power to siphon some of the damage from the triggering attack and take it yourselves. You know Aposyntheto cares deeply for an ally if he knows this will cause him to lose his super cool decorative shoulder spike using this ability.\nEffect Target ally of the triggering melee Strike takes half of the damage they would have received from the triggering Strike. Then you *and* Aposyntheto take the other half of the damage. Aposyntheto takes this damage in the form of Shard Points, reducing the Shard Points value by what it would take in damage.","meta":{"public":0,"url":"JmpyvFO0"}}

Ashen Bone Shards do not expire, so save excess Ashen Bone Shards to recharge Aposyntheto later.\n- *Aposyntheto Evolves* and its abilities are an *extension* of all of the abilities and systems gained in *Aposyntheto Takes Shape*. You still have access to all of the skills from the lower Shard Point ranges in *Aposyntheto Takes Form* when you are taking abilities from *Aposyntheto Evolves*.\n-\nAposyntheto has grown to look like an entire arm of black armor, reaching from fingertip all the way past the right shoulder, forming a dramatically large decorative spike to form a portion of a pauldron. But why is there such an extravagant spike? Wouldn't it be better to spread out the material and cover more of the wielder ultimately protecting them better? Fuck, no.\nYou gain access to the following ability:\n**Self Sacrifice** (R) An ally is about to take an especially dangerous Strike. You and Aposyntheto take on some of the pain from the Strike for yourselves. Trigger An ally within 30-feet is a target of a critical Strike.\n-\nShard Points (180 - 249)\nAposyntheto's form now stretches past your right arm and extends over both of your shoulders. It feels like normal armor, but much more comfortable because it doesn't tend to shift around, being fused to your body and all. And yes, both shoulders are equipped with properly over-compensating shoulder spikes. \n\nYou gain access to the following ability:\n**Sacrificial Heroic Recovery** (F) You and Aposyntheto use your vitality to gain the effects of the Cleric feat *Heroic Recovery*.\n-\nShard Points (250 - 329)\nAposyntheto now stretches beyond your shoulders and now almost covers your entire left arm. He also covers the top half of your torso in both the front and back. Etched across the surface are small patterns consisting of thin wavy lines traversing all the way around the armor and meeting back at the same place it started, showing no ends and no beginnings.\n\nYou gain access to the following ability: \n**Sacrificial Defensive Recovery** (F) You and Aposyntheto use your vitality to gain the effects of the Cleric feat *Defensive Recovery*.","meta":{"public":0,"url":"6ZljVlBq"}}

The pulverized bone is then moved into a heat-resistant container over the heat source and scorched for the rest of the ritual's duration. The sounds of screams and occasional cries of help from the heating bone grinds are completely normal and should be ignored to the best of your ability.\n-\n-\nYou check the container for Ashen Bone Shards.

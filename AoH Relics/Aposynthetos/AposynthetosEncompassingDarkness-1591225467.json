Aposyntheto helps you familiarize yourself with your shadow, granting some ability to interact with it.\n-\nAposyntheto helps you interact with your shadow at your feet, allowing the shadow to be able to hold objects. You can Interact (A) with your shadow to store or remove objects, just like you would a mundane container. Your shadow can contain 3 Bulk of objects, which donâ€™t count toward the Bulk you are carrying. At 6th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, you can store 1 additional Bulk of objects in your shadow. While the items are in your shadow and can be detected normally, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus to Stealth checks to Conceal the Objects unless someone knows to check your shadow for items.","meta":{"public":0,"url":"VRYXWrwb"}}

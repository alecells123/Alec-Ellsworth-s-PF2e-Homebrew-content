{"id":"e01444693dc58bcde9a9ce00b","tags":[],"name":"Spathi Anemou","type":"Relic","level":"","traits":"unique,evocation","actions":"","body":"**Source** Alec Ellsworth\n-\nUsage held in 1 hand; Bulk -\n-\nPrice less; Damage 1d8 S\nHands 1; \n**Category** Martial \nGroup Sword\n-\nThe Spathi Anemou, it resembles a slightly curved saber, but unlike every other saber, neigh, unlike every other blade history has seen, not one has been crafted with feathers along the blade. I can't imagine the feathers really help its strength, or speed. This was the thoughts of everyone who laid eyes on Spathi until a broken man who craves control over all else, posing as a monster hunter finds Spathi Anemou and takes it out of his enemy's hands. The blade felt sorry for the man, so bound to the material plane, so bound to the inconsistent, fickle whims of the gods that look over Hispereia. Spathi wants to show him joy in things that can never die, like the wind and acceptance of others. Spathi will have to be patient, but if anyone can do it, it's Spathi Anemou, the wind blade. \n-\n**Wind Power** is a resource exclusive to Spathi Anemou and his wielder. It is generated by special attacks and spent to create potent effects. Any wind power left after a minute is wasted. Only when following the teachings of Spathi Anemou do wielders find their true power. \n**Wind Spirit** bonus damage is a set bonus damage that gets added to different attacks under certain circumstances. This damage is not doubled on a Critical Strike. \n**Wind Direction** can be used to trigger certain abilities. If there is natural wind at the top of initiative, Spathi's wielder should roll 1d4 to determine the orientation of the wind. Because this is a unique mechanic to Spathi Anemou, feel free to decide which number represents which direction on the battle map. You can only attempt to change the direction of the wind after the beginning of the encounter with specific abilities. \n-\nSpathi Anemou is a Relic, and as such maintains the level of the user and its abilities are bound to that to who it is bonded with, which can only one user and cannot be used by any other user under any circumstances. You can add runes to Spathi Anemou just as if he were a regular blade. Spathi Anemou grants several different abilities as the user grows by level with the Relic, these are known as Gifts. The following gifts are abilities automatically obtained upon reaching the listed level. \n-\n**Fly spells and similar effects will instantly dispel** if targeting someone bonded with Spathi Anemou. Spathi will not have any of that spiritless air movement. Repeated attempts are likely to upset Spathi.\n-\n\nLevel 1: \n**Spathi's Call**: Attack at a range with the power of Spathi's wind spirits and utilize your environments to make slaughter a joyous dance. \n-\nLevel 5: \n**Spathi's Freedom**: Spathi Anemou can now fly and travel by itself and you can even attack through him. \n-\nLevel 9: \n**Spathi's Flow**: Lower fall damage, jump easier, and lots of helpful maneuvering for anywhere there is air. \n-\nLevel 13: \n**Spathi's Determination**: Attack creatures knocked airborne as a reaction.

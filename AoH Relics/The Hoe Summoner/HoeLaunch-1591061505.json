Make a ranged attack against the target. On a success, apply damage like normal. You are now considered connected to the target of the successful attack. This allows use of actions with the **connected** trait with the target of your last Hoe Launch as the target of those abilities. This can target anything. This target *can* be used with a shield attached to the arm, but all manipulate action restrictions on this arm are still in place, preventing from using the shield for anything while connected to another target. \nWhen you have the **connected** trait, The Hoe Summoner loses the ability to use any manipulate actions until you no longer have the **connected** trait. This includes blocking with a shield or making an unarmed attack. You also cannot be any further from your target than the range of The Hoe Summoner. If your target tries to move away, they are granted the ability to use the **Yank** ability.","meta":{"public":0,"url":"WvBwMq3c"}}
